        <p>
            I am a software development enthusiast with eight years of experience in the engineering area. I have a proven ability to deliver complex engineering projects on time and to a high standard. I am a great team player and can find solutions to complex work problems on a tight schedule. My current job involves working, communicating and problem-solving. I started learning to code at the university, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus. Over time, as I learnt more and more, I realised that software development was the right field for me. My current career goal is to change and transition to software development to work in a fulfilling and challenging position.I typically use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. Currently, I focus on building projects that teach me the fundamentals of each tech stack and allow me to practise problem-solving.
